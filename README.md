# GO_Sample_Generator
This sample generator is based off the code in velocirobbie/make-graphitics
https://github.com/velocirobbie/make-graphitics.git

When starting out with the modification to it, I was new to GitHub, and did not do a proper fork. The main code is still that of Robbie Sinclair (https://github.com/velocirobbie), albeit with a lot of modifications, and additions and removals of several features.
