# GO_Sample_Generator
This sample generator is based off the code in velocirobbie/make-graphitics
https://github.com/velocirobbie/make-graphitics.git

Being new to GitHub and everything I started using and modifying it a lot, without creating a fork. The main code is still that of Robbie Sinclair (https://github.com/velocirobbie), albeit with a lot of modifications.
